Honey Production Project

Overview
This project aims to analyze honey production data in the United States using linear regression to understand trends and predict future honey production. Given the alarming decline in honeybee populations, this analysis seeks to investigate historical data and project future outcomes.


Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to:


Explore the honey production dataset.
Apply linear regression to analyze trends.
Predict future honey production based on historical data.


Repository Structure
